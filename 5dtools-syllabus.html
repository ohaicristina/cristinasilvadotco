        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>
            This course is an introduction to making websites using HTML and
            CSS. We will explore the basic concepts, syntax, and application of
            HTML and CSS and how they work together to create online content.
        </p>

        <p>
            This class is the Tools component of 5D Fundamentals: Experience and
            Drawing ARTG-2223. It aims to provide you with the skills and
            knowledge necessary to execute your goals for projects in that
            course.
        </p>

        <p>
            You should leave the class with a strong understanding of how to create
            a basic website with HTML and CSS, the syntax and form of these
            languages, and how to use online resources to learn more.

        <h2>What You'll Need</h2>

        <h3>Curiosity</h3>
        <p>
            The best way to learn web development is through experimentation and
            asking questions. One of the most important questions to keep asking
            is "What would happen if I did x?", then doing it and seeing the
            result. Luckily, the rest of the answers to our questions can be
            found at good ol' Google.com.
        </p>
        <h3>Organization &amp; an Eye for Detail</h3>
        <p>
            Computers are dumb. They will only do what you tell them to do, not
            what you mean for them to do. Typos, messy folders, and laziness can
            be the bane of your existence. Pay close attention to your code and
            follow instructions.
        </p>

        <h3>Patience</h3>
        <p>
            Coding is tricky. You'll probably want to smash your laptop at least
            once this semester. Resist this temptation. You'll get through it
            with a little practice and repetition.
        </p>

        <h3>Persistence</h3>
        <p>
            Not only can coding be a valuable skill to add to your resume, but the
            ever evolving medium of the web allows us to create interactive, unique
            and exciting content. If you're up for the challenge, bringing your
            designs to life is a satisfaction of its own.

    <h2>Course Expectations</h2>
    <div class="class-information-block">
        <h3>Attendance</h3>
        <p>
            Attendance is mandatory for this class. Miss more than three
            classes, and you will lose a letter grade for each class you miss.
            If you do need to miss class, it is up to you to find out what you
            missed during the lesson from myself or your classmates and you are
            still expected to hand in the homework on time.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="class-information-block">
        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>
            Each homework assignment will be worth between 5 and 15 points. If
            you come to class, do the assignments and follow instructions, you
            will pass. If you ask good questions, try to fully learn and
            understand the content and give a good effort youâ€™ll likely get an
            A.

    <h2>Classtime and Assignments</h2>
    <div class="class-information-block">
        <h3>Class Format</h3>
        <p>
            Each week we will have a brief presentation and/or a code
            demonstration. As the semester goes on, we will have more
            independent in-class work time, especially to coordinate with
            deadlines and assignments for the main 5D Fundamentals class.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="class-information-block">
        <h3>Handing in Assignments</h3>
        <p>
        We'll be using Dropbox to hand in assignments.</p>
        <p>
            Each week, a link to upload your files will be posted to the course
            website along with the assignment itself. Please make sure you're
            including ALL files included in your site including images, fonts,
            etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Homework is due before class starts the following week unless
            otherwise specified. Late submissions will not be accepted, however
            you will have a chance at the end of the semester to redo
            assignments for extra credit.

        <h3>Materials</h3>
        <p>
            The only materials you'll need are a text editor and something to
            take notes with.<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a>
            and <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> are popular text editors and are
            free to download. I also recommend using Google Chrome or Firefox as
            your web browser for web development.
